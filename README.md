**CoilSnake** is the most powerful [mod making tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mod) for the game
[*EarthBound*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound).
CoilSnake deconstructs the game's assets into individual text and PNG files, and then lets you "build" a new ROM
using modified assets.
Most of the game's data is editable by CoilSnake, making it possible to create entirely new games in the *EarthBound*
engine.
